This is a fun app I put together using `Next.js` and [the Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/overview), hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). It's primary application is finding books for purchase on Google Books with a fun new UX âœ¨

Took a lot of inspo from the [Google Books website](https://books.google.com/) as well as [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/). Hope you enjoy!
